      </section>

      <section id="ads">
        <h2>6. AdMob & Non-Personalized Advertising</h2>
        <p>Vizique displays advertisements using the Google AdMob SDK. Vizique has configured AdMob to serve <strong>non-personalized ads only</strong> to all users, worldwide, without exception.</p>
        <p>Non-personalized ads do not use behavioral tracking, demographic targeting, or cross-app activity.</p>

        <h3>6.1 Information Processed by Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>To serve non-personalized ads, Google may automatically process limited technical information, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>IP address (for coarse region determination)</li>
          <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
          <li>App instance identifiers required for ad delivery</li>
          <li>Ad performance and diagnostic information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vizique does not collect, store, or access this information.</p>

        <h3>6.2 No Personalized Advertising</h3>
        <p>Vizique strictly prohibits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Behavioral targeting</li>
          <li>Interest-based personalization</li>
          <li>Demographic targeting</li>

          <li>Cross-app or cross-site tracking</li>
          <li>Sale or sharing of user information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 Google as Independent Data Controller</h3>
        <p>Google determines the means and purposes of processing Ad Data under its own privacy policies. Vizique does not control, access, or store this information.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="security">
        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>Although Vizique does not store user data on its servers, we implement security measures including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTTPS/TLS encrypted communication for all App requests</li>
          <li>In-memory-only processing architecture</li>
          <li>No external analytics or tracking scripts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AdMob communications are also encrypted as required by Google.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="children">
        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Vizique does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13. All ads shown to minors are automatically served as non-personalized under AdMob’s child-directed processing requirements.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="persistence">
        <h2>9. Data Persistence, Retention, and Removal</h2>
        <p>Persistent data exists only on your device or in your personal iCloud account. Deleting the App removes local data but not iCloud data.</p>
        <p>You may delete iCloud-stored data through your Apple device settings. Vizique cannot access or modify iCloud data.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ccpa">
        <h2>10. CCPA / CPRA Compliance</h2>
        <p>Because Vizique does not collect or store Personal Information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No Personal Information is sold or shared</li>
          <li>No opt-out mechanisms are required</li>
          <li>No access, correction, or deletion requests apply to Vizique</li>
        </ul>
