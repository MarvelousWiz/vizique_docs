  <h1>Privacy Policy for Vizique</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: November 4, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>At <strong>Vizique</strong>, your privacy is our priority.<br>
  This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>Vizique does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information, health data, or user-generated content.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not create user accounts.</li>
    <li>We do not use third-party analytics, advertising trackers, or data profiling tools.</li>
    <li>We do not sell or share data with any third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Temporary Processing</h2>
  <p>When you use Vizique’s features, such as generating a fitness summary, your data (e.g., uploaded image or input values) is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sent securely to our backend API only for real-time processing.</li>
    <li>Processed temporarily in memory to generate results.</li>
    <li>Automatically deleted immediately after processing is complete.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not retain or store any of this information on our servers or databases.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Stored on Your Device and in iCloud</h2>
  <p>All generated insights, images, or results remain stored only on your device or, if enabled, within your personal iCloud Key-Value Storage.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>iCloud storage is managed and controlled by Apple under your Apple ID.</li>
    <li>Vizique does not have access to any identifiers or data stored in your iCloud account.</li>
    <li>Apple may assign internal identifiers to manage synchronization between your devices, but Vizique does not collect, use, or share these identifiers.</li>
    <li>Syncing via iCloud allows your preferences and app data (such as fitness summaries) to appear across your Apple devices.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If iCloud is disabled, your data will remain stored locally on your device only.</p>

  <h2>4. iCloud Synchronization</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Certain small pieces of app data — such as your fitness summary information and preferences — are securely synced through Apple’s iCloud Key-Value storage to keep your experience consistent across devices.</li>
    <li>This synchronization is handled entirely by Apple.</li>
    <li>Vizique does not have access to any identifiers or data stored in your iCloud account.</li>
    <li>No photos, workouts, workout logs, or other personal content are synced or transmitted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>While Vizique does not store user data on its own servers, we maintain secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS) for all communications to protect your privacy during processing.<br>
  All device-stored and iCloud-synced data remain encrypted and protected by Apple’s security infrastructure.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Vizique does not collect any personal information and does not target or track users of any age.<br>
  If a child under 13 uses the app, no personal data is collected, stored, or shared.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Persistence and Removal</h2>
  <p>Your app progress and summaries are stored locally or in your personal iCloud account.<br>
  Deleting the app may remove local data from your device but will not delete any data already synced with your iCloud account.<br>
  You can manage or delete iCloud data through your Apple device settings.</p>

  <h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as our features evolve. Any updates will appear on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:<br>
