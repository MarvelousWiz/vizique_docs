      </section>

      <section id="admob">
        <h2>3. Third‑Party Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
        <p>Vizique may use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements within the App. While Vizique itself does not collect personal information, AdMob may collect and process certain data independently. This data collection is governed by Google’s privacy policies and is not accessible to Vizique.</p>

        <h3>3.1. Information AdMob May Collect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Device information (e.g., device model, OS version)</li>
          <li>Mobile advertising identifiers (e.g., Apple IDFA)</li>
          <li>IP addresses</li>
          <li>Approximate location (derived from IP)</li>
          <li>Ad engagement metrics (views, clicks, impressions)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2. How AdMob Uses This Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Serving ads and limiting ad frequency</li>
          <li>Detecting fraud and abuse</li>
          <li>Improving ad performance and relevance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3. Ad Personalization</h3>
        <p>Depending on your region and device settings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You may receive <strong>non‑personalized ads</strong> (targeted using contextual data only), or</li>
          <li>You may opt in to <strong>personalized ads</strong> (using behavior and interest signals collected by Google).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4. Opt‑Out and Controls</h3>
        <p>You may manage your ad preferences through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your device settings ("Limit Ad Tracking" or "Personalized Ads")</li>
          <li>Google’s Ad Settings</li>
          <li>App‑level consent screens (where required by law)</li>
        </ul>

      </section>

      <section id="temp">
        <h2>4. Temporary Processing</h2>
        <p>Certain App functions require the temporary, real-time handling of data you choose to provide. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your data is transmitted securely over encrypted channels (HTTPS).</li>
          <li>Processing occurs only in volatile memory, never written to disk.</li>
          <li>Temporary Processing Data is immediately deleted once results are returned.</li>
          <li>Vizique does not store, retain, or log any of this data.</li>
          <li>No backups, caches, or historical archives are created.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ephemeral processing is necessary solely for delivering requested functionality.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="device">
        <h2>4. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>All App-generated outputs—including workout plans, fitness summaries, application preferences, settings, and photo-based analyses—are stored locally on your device using the operating system’s native application storage mechanisms.</p>
        
        <h3>4.1 iOS Devices</h3>
        <p>On Apple devices, App data may be stored locally on your device and, if enabled by you, within your personal iCloud Key-Value Storage. Vizique does not have access to your Apple ID, any iCloud-stored files or identifiers, or any information synchronized between your personal devices. All iCloud activity is managed exclusively by Apple and governed by Apple’s privacy and security frameworks.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Android Devices</h3>
        <p>On Android devices, all App-generated outputs are stored locally on your device using Android’s <strong>SharedPreferences</strong> storage system. Vizique does not have access to, and does not collect, retrieve, or monitor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Google account or Google account credentials</li>
          <li>Any data stored on your device outside of the Vizique application sandbox</li>
          <li>Any files, content, or information contained in system-level or third-party backups</li>
          <li>Any data stored by other applications on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All locally stored data remains under your exclusive control and is accessible only through your device’s operating system and permission settings.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="sync">
        <h2>5. Cloud Synchronization and Device Backup</h2>

        <h3>5.1 iCloud Synchronization (iOS)</h3>
        <p>When iCloud is enabled on supported Apple devices, certain limited App data (such as text-based summaries, preferences, and application state values) may synchronize across your personal devices. Such synchronization:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does not include photos, images, biometric data, or sensitive health information</li>
          <li>Is performed entirely by Apple</li>
          <li>Is not accessible, viewable, or controllable by Vizique</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Device Backup (Android)</h3>
        <p>The Vizique app is configured to participate in Android’s automatic device backup system. If Android device backup is enabled through your system settings, certain Vizique app data (including survey responses, fitness summaries, and workout preferences) may be automatically backed up to your personal Google Drive account.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device backup is enabled by default in the Vizique app but may be managed or disabled through your Android system settings</li>
          <li>Backup and restoration occur only between installations of the same application version type (e.g., production-to-production); data will not restore when switching between development, testing, or production builds</li>
          <li>All backup and restoration processes are performed exclusively by Google’s Android operating system</li>
          <li>Vizique does not initiate, manage, access, retrieve, or delete any backed-up data</li>
          <li>Backed-up data is associated with your Google account and governed by Google’s privacy and security policies</li>
          <li>Backups occur periodically in the background and are not instantaneous</li>
          <li>Data restoration occurs only upon reinstallation of the App on the same device or a new device signed into the same Google account, and only if a backup exists prior to uninstallation</li>
          <li>Device backups do not provide real-time or continuous synchronization of App data across multiple devices</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="security">
        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>Although Vizique does not store any user data on its servers, we maintain strong technical safeguards, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encrypted communications (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
          <li>Strict in-memory processing architecture</li>
          <li>Zero-retention data design</li>
          <li>No Vizique-operated tracking scripts or analytics tools</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Device-stored and iCloud-stored data benefit from Apple’s native encryption and authentication protections.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="children">
        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Vizique does not knowingly collect Personal Information from any users, including children under 13. AdMob may impose additional restrictions for child-directed treatments, which are handled automatically by Google where applicable.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="persistence">
        <h2>9. Data Persistence, Retention, and Removal</h2>
        <p>All persistent data exists only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On your device, or</li>
          <li>In your personal iCloud account (subject to your Apple settings).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deleting the App:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removes locally stored data, but</li>
          <li>Does not remove data already stored in your iCloud account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users may delete iCloud-stored data through their Apple device settings. Vizique cannot access or remove data stored within your Apple ID.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ccpa">
        <h2>10. CCPA / CPRA Compliance (California Residents)</h2>
        <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), “Personal Information” includes any information that identifies or relates to a consumer.</p>
        <p>Vizique does not collect Personal Information directly. However, <strong>Google AdMob may collect Personal Information for advertising purposes</strong> as described in Section 3.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vizique does not sell personal information.</li>
          <li>Vizique does not share information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
          <li>Google may process data for advertising purposes under its own privacy framework.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consumers may exercise their rights through Google’s tools and your mobile operating system’s ad settings.</p>

      <section id="transfers">
        <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Vizique does not store or retain Personal Information in any location. However:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Temporary real-time processing may involve communication with servers located outside your region.</li>
          <li>AdMob may transfer or process advertising-related data across global Google infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any such transfers are governed exclusively by Google’s privacy and compliance obligations. Vizique does not retain or control any transferred data.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="updates">
        <h2>12. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update, revise, or modify this Policy from time to time. When changes are made, the “Last Updated” date will be revised. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
