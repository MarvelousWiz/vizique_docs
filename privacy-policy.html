        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
        <p>For clarity and consistency, the following terms are used in this Policy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> or <strong>“Personal Information”</strong> means information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be associated with an individual, as defined under applicable privacy laws (e.g., CCPA). Vizique does not collect Personal Information.</li>
          <li><strong>“Processing”</strong> means any operation performed on data, including collection, transmission, storage, deletion, or analysis. Vizique processes data only temporarily and solely in-memory.</li>
          <li><strong>“Temporary Processing Data”</strong> means any images, metrics, or information voluntarily provided by the user for real-time computation and immediately discarded after use.</li>
          <li><strong>“iCloud Storage”</strong> refers to Apple’s Key-Value Storage mechanism under your Apple ID, controlled exclusively by Apple.</li>
          <li><strong>“User”</strong> or <strong>“You”</strong> means any individual who downloads, installs, accesses, or uses the Vizique App.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="dontcollect">
        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Vizique does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, retain, or share:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal Information</li>
          <li>Health data or fitness metrics</li>
          <li>Photos or user-generated content</li>
          <li>Contact information</li>
          <li>Device identifiers, advertising identifiers, or IP-based analytics</li>
          <li>Cookies, tracking technologies, or behavioral profiles</li>
          <li>Log data, usage data, or crash analytics</li>
          <li>Any metadata associated with uploaded images</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vizique does not sell, trade, license, or disclose data to any third party. If a category of information is not expressly described as collected, it is <strong>not</strong> collected.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="temp">
        <h2>3. Temporary Processing</h2>
        <p>Certain App functions require the temporary, real-time handling of data you choose to provide. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your data is transmitted securely over encrypted channels (HTTPS).</li>
          <li>Processing occurs only in volatile memory, never written to disk.</li>
          <li>Temporary Processing Data is immediately deleted once results are returned.</li>
          <li>Vizique does not store, retain, or log any of this data.</li>
          <li>No backups, caches, or historical archives are created.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ephemeral processing is necessary solely for delivering requested functionality.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="device">
        <h2>4. Data Stored on Your Device and in iCloud</h2>
        <p>All App outputs—including summaries, settings, or images—are stored:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Locally on your device, and/or</li>
          <li>In your personal iCloud Key-Value Storage (if enabled on your device).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vizique does not have access to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Apple ID</li>
          <li>Any iCloud-stored files, data, or identifiers</li>
          <li>Information synced between your personal devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All iCloud activity is controlled exclusively by Apple and governed by Apple’s privacy and security frameworks.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="sync">
        <h2>5. iCloud Synchronization</h2>
        <p>When iCloud is enabled:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Limited App data (workouts, summaries, preferences, small text/state values) may sync across your Apple devices.</li>
          <li>No photos/images, logs, biometric data, or sensitive information are synced.</li>
          <li>Vizique cannot view, retrieve, modify, or delete any synchronized information.</li>
          <li>Apple independently manages all iCloud-related transfers and storage.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="security">
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>Although Vizique does not store any user data on its servers, we maintain strong technical safeguards, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encrypted communications (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
          <li>Strict in-memory processing architecture</li>
          <li>Zero-retention data design</li>
          <li>No third-party analytics or external tracking scripts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Device-stored and iCloud-stored data benefit from Apple’s native encryption and authentication protections.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="children">
        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Vizique does not knowingly collect Personal Information from any users, including children under 13. Because the App collects no data, no child-specific consent mechanism is required under COPPA or related laws.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="persistence">
        <h2>8. Data Persistence, Retention, and Removal</h2>
        <p>All persistent data exists only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On your device, or</li>
          <li>In your personal iCloud account (subject to your Apple settings).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deleting the App:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removes locally stored data, but</li>
          <li>Does not remove data already stored in your iCloud account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users may delete iCloud-stored data through their Apple device settings. Vizique cannot access or remove data stored within your Apple ID.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ccpa">
        <h2>9. CCPA / CPRA Compliance (California Residents)</h2>
        <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), “Personal Information” includes any information that identifies or relates to a consumer.</p>
        <p>Vizique does <strong>not</strong> collect, share, sell, or process Personal Information. Accordingly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not sell personal information.</li>
          <li>We do not share information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
          <li>We do not engage in profiling or automated decision-making.</li>
          <li>Consumer rights to access, delete, correct, or opt-out are not applicable, as no personal information is collected or retained.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If our practices change in the future, this Policy will be updated.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="transfers">
        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Vizique does not store or retain Personal Information in any location. However, temporary real-time processing may involve communication with servers located outside your region. Such processing is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conducted only in temporary memory</li>
          <li>Immediately deleted after use</li>
          <li>Never stored, logged, or archived</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because Vizique does not retain data, international transfer restrictions related to stored or processed Personal Information do not apply. Any iCloud data transfers are governed exclusively by Apple’s infrastructure and policies.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="updates">
        <h2>11. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update, revise, or modify this Policy from time to time. When changes are made, the “Last Updated” date will be revised. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
      </section>
