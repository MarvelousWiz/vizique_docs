# Privacy Policy for Vizique
__Last updated: November 4, 2025__

At **Vizique**, your privacy is our priority.  
This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.



## 1. Information We Do Not Collect
Vizique does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information, health data, or user-generated content.

- We do not create user accounts.  
- We do not use third-party analytics, advertising trackers, or data profiling tools.  
- We do not sell or share data with any third parties.



## 2. Temporary Processing
When you use Vizique’s features, such as generating a fitness summary, your data (e.g., uploaded image or input values) is:

- Sent securely to our backend API only for real-time processing.  
- Processed temporarily in memory to generate results.  
- Automatically deleted immediately after processing is complete.

We do not retain or store any of this information on our servers or databases.



## 3. Data Stored on Your Device and in iCloud
All generated insights, images, or results remain stored only on your device or, if enabled, within your personal iCloud Key-Value Storage.

- iCloud storage is managed and controlled by Apple under your Apple ID.  
- Vizique does not have access to any identifiers or data stored in your iCloud account.  
- Apple may assign internal identifiers to manage synchronization between your devices, but Vizique does not collect, use, or share these identifiers.  
- Syncing via iCloud allows your preferences and app data (such as fitness summaries) to appear across your Apple devices.

If iCloud is disabled, your data will remain stored locally on your device only.



## 4. Security
While Vizique does not store user data on its own servers, we maintain secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS) for all communications to protect your privacy during processing.  
All device-stored and iCloud-synced data remain encrypted and protected by Apple’s security infrastructure.



## 5. Children’s Privacy
Vizique does not collect any personal information and does not target or track users of any age.

If a child under 13 uses the app, no personal data is collected, stored, or shared.



## 6. Data Persistence and Removal
Your app progress and summaries are stored locally or in your personal iCloud account.

Deleting the app may remove local data from your device but will not delete any data already synced with your iCloud account.  
You can manage or delete iCloud data through your Apple device settings.



## 7. Updates to This Policy
We may update this policy as our features evolve. Any updates will appear on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
