        <h2>1. General Information</h2>
        <p>Vizique is a visual health and fitness insight application that provides users with visual, analytical, and statistical tools to assist in understanding general fitness progress.</p>
        <p>The App is intended <strong>solely for informational and educational purposes</strong> and does not constitute medical advice, professional diagnosis, treatment, or a personalized fitness prescription.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="health">
        <h2>2. Health and Safety Disclaimer</h2>

        <h3>a. No Medical or Professional Advice</h3>
        <p>Vizique does not provide medical, clinical, therapeutic, or professional health or fitness advice. The App’s content, including any analysis, insights, recommendations, or suggested workout sets or repetitions, is not a substitute for consultation with a licensed physician, certified trainer, or other qualified healthcare professional.</p>

        <h3>b. Consultation Requirement</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that you will consult with an appropriate healthcare provider before initiating or modifying any exercise regimen, nutrition plan, or physical activity, particularly if you have—or may have—any injury, medical condition, disability, or health concern.</p>

        <h3>c. Use of Physiological Data</h3>
        <p>Vizique’s analysis model is currently optimized based on male physiology data. While the App may be used by individuals of any gender, you understand and agree that accuracy, analysis, or performance insights may vary for female users or users whose physiological characteristics differ from the underlying model assumptions.</p>

        <h3>d. User Responsibility for Physical Activity</h3>
        <p>By using the App, you expressly acknowledge, represent, and warrant that you are solely responsible for evaluating and determining whether any physical activity is safe, appropriate, and suitable for your personal health, physical condition, and fitness level.</p>

        <h3>e. Assumption of Risk</h3>
        <p>You voluntarily assume all risks associated with any physical activities undertaken in reliance on the App. Vizique and its developers disclaim all liability for injuries, adverse health outcomes, or damages arising from your use or misuse of the App or any exercise activities you elect to perform.</p>

      <section id="liability">
        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:</p>

        <h3>a. No Warranty</h3>
        <p>Vizique is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranties, representations, or guarantees of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, reliability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>

        <h3>b. No Liability for Damages</h3>
        <p>In no event shall any Vizique Party be liable for any damages of any kind, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Direct damages,</li>
          <li>Indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive, or special damages,</li>
          <li>Loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business opportunity,</li>
          <li>Loss or corruption of data,</li>
          <li>Personal injury, bodily harm, or death,</li>
          <li>Property damage,</li>
          <li>Downtime, service interruption, or inability to access the App,</li>
          <li>Damages arising out of system failures, data breaches, unauthorized access, or security vulnerabilities,</li>
          <li>Damages arising from your reliance on any results, insights, visualizations, or recommendations generated by the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory under which a claim is brought—contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—even if the Vizique Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages or such damages were reasonably foreseeable.</p>

        <h3>c. User Responsibility</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge that you alone are responsible for evaluating and verifying the safety, appropriateness, and suitability of any physical activity you choose to perform based on information provided by the App. You voluntarily assume all risks associated with your use of the App.</p>

Your continued use of Vizique after the posting of revised Terms constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
